# Football Player Analytics

## Problem Statement
The global football industry is facing a critical challenge in effectively managing and analyzing vast amounts of player data to make informed decisions. We aim to address this issue by leveraging Tableau to provide a detailed analysis of FIFA player statistics. We can focus on identifying key trends and insights, such as the countries with the highest number of players, the evolution of player participation over time, the distribution of player skills and attributes and other details.

## Description
The data consists of 18,205 rows and 25 columns informing on numerous player statistics. The 'Position' and 'Joined' columns contained null values which needed to be filtered out while creating the plots. Euro symbol appeared before values in the 'Value' and 'Wage' features along with 'K' or 'M' at the end representing values in thousands or millions respectively which were cleaned into purely numeric measures. Moreover, the 'Contract Valid Until' column supposed to contain years had complete dates in some rows from which years were extracted into a new dimension. Charts were developed using the data to make out data-driven insights.

## Outcome
Visualizations involving nation-wise population and youth of players, annual player joinings, player body types and financial trends among other factors were explored to understand the data in detail and valuable stories from the data were written.
